# zstick2538
USB dongle, that can be used as Zigbee Coordinator in home automation hubs like Home Assistant, ioBroker, OpenHab ect.<p>
Fully compatible with [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/). 

## PCB
Based on [Zigbee Stick v3.1](https://easyeda.com/mercenaruss/zigbee-stick-v3). <p>
I edited it a little so that most of the components of PCB are placed on one side. When ordering at JLCPCB with SMT assembly service, only CC2538+CC2592 breakout board, USB-A connector, programming header and SMA connector has to be soldered manually. <br>
You can find my project on [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/mmodestas/mm_zigbee_stick_v3-1_copy).<p>

## Case
I designed 3D printed case. Printing with PET-G. Sanding and painting with black matte paint is used for post-processing.
[1551USB3CLR](https://www.hammfg.com/part/1551USB3CLR) case could also be used. However, I did not try it yet.

## Firmware
Zstack 3.0.x <p>
